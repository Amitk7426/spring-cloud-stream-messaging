# Designing Event Driven Services with Spring Cloud Stream and RabbitMQ

## Introduction :

Spring Cloud Stream is a framework built on top of Spring Boot and Spring Integration framework,  that helps in creating event-driven microservices at scale.
In this application I introduce a simple order processing application using the capability of Spring Cloud Stream , following the  event driven micoservice architecture. 
## Overview of the application : 
It consists of four independent microservices. 
**gateway-service**,
**order-service**,
**account-service** and 
**product-service**

Communication between **order-service** and the **account-service** happens through orders-in and orders-out channels .Since order-service is the source of the message ,
it sends messages to it's output channel. On the other hand, account-service
listens for incoming messages on the input channel. If the order-service output channel
and account-service input channel do not refer to the same destination on the broker, the
communication between them would fail.This configuration has been provided in the application.yml of the order-service and the account-service. Also the default topic exchange in spring cloud stream has been overidden with direct exchange to implement a point to point communication . As a note,  in this branch I am showing a point to point communication between order-service and account-service. By default spring cloud stream creates a topic exchange, which I have overridden as a direct exchange by mentioning exchangeType:direct in application.yml file.

Call to the Order-service from an external client comes through the API gateway .Order service receives the order and saves it in the repository and sends the order details message to the orders-out channel. Account-service receives the order from the orders-out channel , validates the customer id and calls the product-service over the rest endpoint and retrieves the product ids . If customer has sufficient balance to place the order it sets the order to ACCEPTED else sets the status to REJECTED and send this order status to the orders-in channel . Order-service receives the order status from the orders-in channel and updates the status to the client when requested over an endpoint. Following diagram shows the architecture of the application.
